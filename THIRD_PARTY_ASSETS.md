# Third-party assets

Emberfall keeps its gameplay, rendering, VFX and UI code in this repository. The curated 3D assets below are redistributed under **Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0)** so the browser build can be self-contained.

## KayKit — Adventurers Character Pack 1.0

Creator: Kay Lousberg / KayKit  
Source repository: `KayKit-Game-Assets/KayKit-Character-Pack-Adventures-1.0`  
License: Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0); commercial use permitted; attribution optional.

Used in Maples:

## Quaternius — Animated Monster / Ultimate Monsters assets

Creator: Quaternius  
Original packs: Animated Monster Pack, Ultimate Monsters, Animated Knight Pack  
License: Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0).

The GLB conversions used here were sourced from the public `ilrein/warptracker` repository, whose asset manifest records the original Quaternius packs, conversion provenance and CC0 status.

Used in Maples:

- `public/assets/monsters/briar-skeleton.glb`
- `public/assets/monsters/briar-bat.glb`
- `public/assets/monsters/briar-ghost.glb`
- `public/assets/monsters/thornmaw-demon.glb`
- `public/assets/characters/rowan-sword.glb` — retained as an alternate sword asset; Rowan currently uses the sword already included in the KayKit Knight GLB.

## Quaternius — Stylized Nature MegaKit

Creator: Quaternius  
Original pack: Stylized Nature MegaKit  
License: Creative Commons Zero (CC0 1.0).

A deliberately small GLB subset was curated from the public `petroulacl/fps-buildings-env-kit` mirror, whose README records the vegetation set as Quaternius Stylized Nature MegaKit / CC0. The game instances these few source models many times rather than shipping the full pack.

Used in Maples:

- `public/assets/nature/lumen-pine.glb`
- `public/assets/nature/flowering-bush.glb`
- `public/assets/nature/fern.glb`
- `public/assets/nature/wispy-grass.glb`
